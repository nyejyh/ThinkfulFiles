    "# You have a total of 3 doors to pick from, and one has been revealed to be a dud.\n",
    "# The knowledge that one door is a dud means that you now have 2 other doors to pick.\n",
    "# But the door that you picked may or may not be a dud.\n",
    "# The door you picked being a dud is now 1/2 instead of 2/3.\n",
    "# The door you picked being a prize is now 1/2 instead of 1/3.\n",
    "# But this calculation is wrong.  If using Bayes' Rule: P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B).\n",
    "# So P(Prize | Empty) = P(Empty | Prize) * P(Prize) / P(Empty)\n",
    "# = 1/2 * (1/2)/(1/2) = 1/2\n",
    "# Therefore, it should be that you have no reason to switch doors.\n",
